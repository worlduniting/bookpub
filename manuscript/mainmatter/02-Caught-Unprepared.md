# Caught Unprepared

There in the absence, a far-away feeling emerged.

Cold...a distant cold...advancing quickly toward me, picking up speed at an alarming rate. I couldn't quite tell what it was...but I knew I was afraid.

Like a locomotive barreling down its tracks on a collision course, it hit me, crashing into every human sense I had. The cold, the wind, the rain---every part of the storm, struck every part of me, all at once.

As I came to, the chaos came flooding in, one terrible tidal wave of danger. I had wakened, not from a nightmare, but into one.

My mind was spinning in place, frantically trying to decide which threat to respond to first.

For the briefest of moments, I lay there floating in a blurred recollection of where I was and what was happening---struggling to grasp a hold of the reality around me.

But something pulled me into focus...quickly. A searing-cold stream of icy water rushed under my jacket, down my exposed neck and back, leaving a burning trail in its wake. At the same time, the biting cold rain pelted my face, stinging me like a hive of a hundred angry bees.

I lifted my head from the rock floor beneath me. It was throbbing, pounding in a steady rhythm with my heartbeat---BUM-bum, BUM-bum, BUM-bum.

*Did I hit my head?*

I lifted my hat and felt through my hair. A massive lump had formed on one side. I pulled my hand down, examining it. There was nothing on it, no crimson streaks of blood...much to my relief.

I sat completely exposed, taking the full brunt of the wind and rain. I needed to move.

Grabbing onto a large rock to my side, I attempted to pull myself up against the blustering wind and blistering rain.

I lifted myself, trying to stand upright, straightening my leg and putting my weight down on it.

Just under my kneecap, a piercing bolt of pain shot up my leg, wrapping itself around my thigh and up my lower back. It felt like someone had driven a hot poker straight into my knee.

I shifted the weight back to my other leg and waited a moment for the pain to subside. One thing's for sure, any remaining haziness in my mind was now gone.

I looked around, making every effort to determine which of the hundred hazards posed the most hostile threat.

It was all too much.

I needed to take a breath and compose myself and I needed to make a plan.

<div class="section" id="awful-truth">

## The Awful Truth

A checklist of terrible truths began to form in my mind.

1. I was on a giant flat rocky without shelter or relief.
2. I was now trapped in a torrential downpour of ice-cold rain.
3. The wind was blowing at around 20-30mph.
4. My water-*resistant* outfit would provide little relief from the elements.
5. The temperature would be dropping below 40°F.
6. My visibility was now limited to about ten feet.
7. I had to get off the rock.

In the short time since the storm hit, every ounce of clothing had already been rendered useless. I was already soaked through. More importantly, I was cold---and that would become a problem.

A giant push of adrenalin and endorphins shot through my veins. The pain in my head and knee fell away, replaced now with an overwhelming fear. I was fully occupied by the dire danger of my situation. The pain would have to wait.

There was no time to lose. I couldn't just stay there nursing my wounds.

I had to get off that rock. I had to get off it, NOW!

Still a bit dizzy, I braced myself a bit against a large rock next to me, putting my full weight on my good leg, and then onto the injured one. It was painful at first, but I knew I could press through it. Thankfully, one silver lining of the cold was that it would help to keep the swelling down.

I began to move forward and started to take a quick inventory of my status.

Looking around me, I sized up what I could and tried to take stock of where I was. The cloud had overtaken the rock and left my visibility to only a few feet. My only hope was to look for those huge rocks I had seen earlier before the storm started.

Unfortunately, the fall had disoriented me.

Where was I? Which direction was I facing now? Should I continue moving forward? When I fell, did I get turned around?

I knew I couldn't just stand there. Every second I hesitated, I was exposing myself to the elements and risking the possibility of lowering my body temperature. Time was the primary importance. I knew I couldn't waste any of it.

It was cold..so very cold.

When I initially arrived on the rock, it was chilly but manageable, around forty-six degrees. Now, the temperature had dropped, and I was already soaked to the bone. The water running down my neck, back, and arms was stealing the warmth from my body at an alarming rate.

My hands were beginning to burn and throb. I tried to keep them in my pockets, which gave little help, as they continued to collect icy water.

The panic began to escalate inside me. I was defenseless against the elements, and I knew it. I knew that I would never be able to hold my body temperature under these circumstances. If I didn't get off of this rock, it wouldn't be a matter of if, but of when, I would fall into hypothermia.

The inevitability of it all felt like utter powerlessness. It wasn't just fear or concern. It was desperation.

I needed to start moving. The activity would, at the very least, help to generate body heat and keep me warmer.

Looking around, I decided on a direction---forward. With my limited sight, it felt like I was blindly throwing a dart at a dartboard. But I wasn't so worried about hitting any bullseye, as I was about merely hitting the board.

I leaned into the wind a bit and began walking, slowly and deliberately. I couldn't suffer another fall.

<div class="section" id="enemy">

## A Dangerous Enemy

Earlier, the terrain had seemed fun and easy to traverse.

Now, it was a minefield of jagged and slippery rocks. Every step needed to be calculated and carefully made.

I continued on for a while, navigating the large holes that had now become large pools of water to wade through. I had to be careful, though. I couldn't wade too deep. It was bad enough that my clothes were wet. Submersing any part of me would only speed up the heat loss.

Off in the distant edge of my view, something began to emerge.

The mist parted for a brief moment, revealing two large dark objects. They stood together, roughly the size of two people huddled together.

*Were those the large rocks I had seen before?!*

Initially, I would have been excited to see them. But something was wrong.

"Oh, God! Why are they on my left?" I shuddered.

I could feel my heart trembling, falling down into my stomach. A wave of nausea came over me as the terrible truth hit.

I had been walking back to the far side of the rock this whole time.

The full weight of the reality struck me hard. Any remote chance I once had of knowing which direction the way off was, had long since vanished into the mist.

As I stood there under the shivering storm, absent of any idea of how to move forward, something malignant began growing inside me. I had felt it earlier but dismissed it without concern. Now, however, it was growing stronger, sprouting up like a weed, choking out the thoughts in my mind, disrupting my ability to stay focused.

Something was taking hold of me---something wild and uncontrollable.

Something primal. Something ingrained and unlearned.

It was panic.

Pure, unrelenting, debilitating panic.

This was a force stronger than fear or terror. It was more powerful than helplessness or hopelessness. And yet, it was inviting. It felt easy---as if I could escape simply by surrendering myself to it. It spoke with an enticing whisper, tempting me to hand over control, to give myself over.

I knew what it was and I understood what it could do. I had to take hold of it. Or it would take hold of me.

As I stood there, fighting off the stranglehold of panic, a gentle memory presented itself amidst the struggle, like a lighthouse offering a guiding light to a ship searching for safe harbor.

A memory from long ago begged me to consider it, to listen and to remember. I took hold of it with both hands and prayed it would help...

I was a young boy, maybe eight. My family had recently moved to Missoula, Montana---my mother's hometown. Her family had settled up in the Mission Valley in the late 1800s. The area was a particular favorite of mine. The sweeping valley told the stories my grandmother shared, of trading with first-nation people, shopping at the only general store, and leading cattle across its great fields of grass. Surrounded by the serene peaks of the "Three Sisters" mountains, it was a place of exceeding beauty, where the ancient rivers still flowed, and herds of buffalo could be found.

One morning, my father, being an avid fisherman, packed my brother and me up for a day of fishing. Our destination was one of the many beautiful rivers hidden away in the Big Sky Country. It was often his preferred choice to drive into the woods a good way and find a place untouched and undisturbed, where we could enjoy the calming sounds of the rushing waters.

My father, believing wholeheartedly that the early bird gets the worm, had pulled us out of our beds and piled us into his truck long before the birds ever woke.

Having found a good spot near a small bridge, he grabbed our rods and tackle boxes and led our half-alive selves up the creek way, just as the sun itself was waking over the mountains.

Soon enough, we came upon a nice-sized fishing hole, where he suggested my brother set up. "Why don't you take this one? Dave and I will go upstream a bit and fish there."

My brother was all too eager to cast his line. I was maybe a bit less so, at least at that age. Back then, my fishing adventures were chiefly composed of hooking myself on some helpless bush behind me. Should some unlucky fish actually find itself on my line, it stood an equal chance of pulling me in, as I did in pulling it out.

Finally reaching another clearing along the water, my father began to set me up. This particular spot sat just downstream from some small rapids that made it rather loud. My father decided to walk upriver a stone's throw away from me and fish there, just in eyeshot of me.

After a few minutes, he decided to find a better spot to fish.

Seeing that I was all set, my dad hollered at me, "Hey Butch (his preferred nickname for me), I'm heading up the creek to find another hole!"

Regrettably, I didn't hear a single word he said over the noisy rapids.

After a short time, I grew tired of hooking tree branches and decided to holler for my dad.

I turned around to look for him...he was nowhere to be seen.

It startled me.

I began to holler for him but heard nothing in return.

Now, as a child eight years old, my first inclination wasn't that my dad my closeby. For some reason, my mind immediately went to the worst-case scenario. He was gone.

I quickly began to panic. So I started to yell louder, "Dad!"

Earlier, he had been upstream, so I decided to run upstream. Nothing. Then I ran downstream for a bit. Nothing.

"Daaaaaaad!" I began to scream almost wildly, giving myself over entirely to my paranoia---my dad was gone and I was alone in the wilderness.

(Of course, it didn't help that we had just watched a movie about a young boy who was lost in the woods.)

That's when I gave myself completely over to the panic.

Rather than sitting down to think things through, I lost control. I started screaming at the top of my lungs, "DAAAAD!". But nothing.

Panic began leading me into even worse danger. Instead of staying put, I started to walk away from the creek, into the woods themselves. I called out, over and over again, but he was nowhere to be seen.

On and on I continued, screaming wildly, walking further and further away from the sound of the water. Before I knew it, I was deep into the woods. I stopped and frantically looked around me.  Then, it hit me…I didn't know where I was.

*Oh my God! I'm lost!*

I was about to start running again, and I didn't care where. But something stopped me.

I heard a faint sound in the distance.

"Dave…?!", "DAVID?!", "BUTCH?!!" It was my Dad.

A wave of warm relief rushed over me as I began to scream and run in his direction.

Finally, I saw him. Bounding over bushes and logs, he ran toward me. "What are you doing out here?! You could have gotten lost! I wouldn't have been able to find you!" He stammered with equal parts relief and frustration.

I fell apart, bawling uncontrollably, relieved to be safe again and to be with my dad.

He put his arm around my shoulders. "You're OK, Dave," he comforted.

We started back to the creek, giving me a chance to calm down a bit. Once we arrived, he sat me down, gave me a fig newton (my favorite fishing snack), and helped me to relax.

Once I had finally collected myself, he sat down next to me on the log, "How you doing, Butch?" I nodded with an affirmative bite of my cookie.

Every eager to teach me a useful lesson, he placed his hand on the back of my neck and vigorously shook my body, causing me to cough up a laugh...and part of my fig newton. He looked over at me, saying, "Well that was scary. But I'm glad I found you. The woods can be a dangerous place. But Dave, you can't let panic take you over. If you are in danger you need to stop, take a moment and calm yourself. OK? Then when you are ready, you can think about what you need to do to get safe. If you panic, you can't think. If you can't think, the danger will win."

Here I was now, on top of this mountain, caught up in danger yet again. Panic was growing quickly inside me, begging me to take control. But this time, the voice of my father came to me, calming my mind like a soothing song, "*Dave, you can't let panic take you over."*

I held the memory in my mind, reassuring myself, taking a deep breath and giving myself permission to calm down.

"David! You can NOT panic! You can find a way. You CAN!" I shouted to myself, and perhaps a bit toward the storm.

This time, I didn't give in. This time, I took control of the panic, pushing it aside. Try as I might, I couldn't get rid of it, but I realized I didn't need to. All I had to do was create some mental room in the midst of the panic, enough to form a plan.

The wind and rain hadn't given up for a second. Even so, I began working hard to calm down and think about my options...while I could.

> 1. I needed to see if I had cell reception to call home and explain my situation, just in case I might need help.
>
> 2. I needed some time to look for the pathway off. I would also need to figure out some method to mark the places I had already checked.
>
> 3. I would either find my way off or, worst-case scenario, call home again go from there and consider alerting Search & Rescue---I couldn't believe I was actually having to entertain the thought.

Onto step one...

I grabbed my phone from my pocket. It was covered in water.

*Would it even work?*

I held the phone under the brim of my hat and clicked on the power button.

*Please, please, please, please, please*

To my relief, the screen flashed on. The phone created a glowing blue cacoon of light around me, wrapping me in a welcome connection to a world that now seemed far removed from my own.

I looked up to the top right of the phone, holding my breath in anticipation.

"4G Full Bars?!" I whispered in absolute astonishment. I stood there, marveling for a singular moment.

Here I was, stranded on top of this torturous rock, trapped in the iron grip of a savage storm, removed from any help by miles of rocky terrain all around me.

Still, right here amid the chaos, I held in my hand a small glowing blue square. A gift of seeming magic from our new age. It alone provided the entrance into a world far far away from my own.

On their side of the glowing glass, a new age of human beings sat blissfully unaware of any doom or danger. They busied themselves at home or in their offices, sipping lattes, debating politics, or arguing about the heat on social media.

All the while, on my side of the glass, I was a human being standing in our old age, imprisoned by nature itself---trapped in the stone arena of a gladiator stadium, in a fight to the death against the tempest.

A huffing laugh escaped me. The irony. Here in my hand, I held an active connection to a world of apathy while standing here at the very height of adversity. With all the ease technology promised us, we had merely created a world where sheer boredom and absolute terror lived ear to ear.

<div class="section" id="calling">

## Calling Home

I needed to call home, so I began to navigate to my phone app. The rain, being blown in every direction, pelted and ran across the screen, making it almost impossible to use. Each drop signaled a touch to the screen which would respond in kind to its command, unable to distinguish my own fingers from God's garden hose.

Somehow, I was able to pull up my contact list and immediately clicked on my spouse, who was no doubt quietly working away.

The calm voice of eight years greeted me with a familiar, "Hey, babe. How's the hike going?"

I paused a moment, mesmerized by the incredible difference between our mental states, wishing I was in that world of comfort and calm.

I knew full well the peril I was facing, but I didn't want to prematurely worry anyone, least of all my spouse. I put on a forced smile.

"Well...unfortunately It's not going so well," I said in the calmest voice I could muster. "I'm having some trouble finding my way off the top of Table Rock, and it's raining pretty hard up here. I'm going to continue to look around and see if I can find the path off. I wanted to call and let you know."

I paused, waiting to hear what the response might be.

A brief period of silence held the line, inferring a bit of concern.

There was nothing unusual about me calling from the trailhead at the start of my hike. However, once I was on the trail, I would typically go incognito till I was back to the trailhead.

"OK..." There was a slight worry in his voice.

Another pause. "Thanks for the heads up. Keep me posted," came the somewhat uneasy reply.

"OK. I'll call you in a half hour either way. Thanks, love," I replied.

I stood there, continuing to hold the phone, and the call, to my head for a moment. I wanted so desperately to stay on the call for as long as possible. I couldn't bring myself to hang up. It was the only connection to my ordinary---and warm---life.

I gazed at the screen, then to the end-call button. The red circle shined like a menacing flame against the mist around me. I stared at the black "X" that sat inexorably fixed in the center. Reluctantly, I pressed the button and dragged it across the screen, feeling a sense of inevitableness as the phone call ended, and I turned off the phone.

I put my phone back in my jacket pocket and stood there for a second.

*How am I going to find my way off?*

"OK, Dave. You've got thirty minutes. Think!" I ordered myself.

I attempted to calm myself down again as I constructed my plan.

I was going to have to find the edge first. Then, I would need to begin making my way around the edge of the rock, looking for the exit. The problem now was visibility. I could only see for a dozen-or-so feet. At a certain distance, that made it difficult to determine if the ledge might level out, or if it instead dropped straight down.

I needed some way to mark where the places I had already explored. But I was surrounded by nothing but rock. No markings. No twigs. No trees. No bushes. Just rocks.

Well, if rocks were all I had, then rocks were what I was going to use.

I devised a strategy...I would walk along the edge of the rock and look for places that might lead off. I would investigate each one. If it turned out to be a dead-end, I would leave a pile of rocks in an "X". If it didn't seem to be the exit, but I wasn't sure, I would leave a pile in a straight line. That way I could go back and explore those later if needed.

I had thirty minutes to find the exit. This would have to be a cursory search. I wouldn't have time to thoroughly explore, so I would have to focus only on the potential exits.

Thirty minutes was not much time. I would have to work quickly.

I picked up a handful of rocks around me and headed in the only direction I could...forward.

Much to my relief, after only a few minutes, I came to the edge. There was only one problem (well, so-to-speak). I didn't know where I was. Should I go left, or should I go right?

I couldn't just stand there under the pouring rain. I flipped an imaginary coin and chose to go right.

I made my way around the rock, getting as close as I could, while still keeping my distance. The wind was unpredictable and it could easily send me over the edge without warning if I wasn't careful.

I worked as quickly as I could. Most of the time, the cliff was obvious. But sometimes, the rock drifted out at a bit of a slope. For those, I had to try and get as close as I could.

As I followed the edge, I kept an eye on the time. There was a lot more ground to cover than I had thought. Even if I found a spot that was favorable, I couldn't spend too much time exploring.

I had hoped the exit would be obvious. In truth, this being my first time on Table Rock, I was finding it difficult to remember exactly what the entrance looked like. There was no obvious sign or flag on top of the rock to mark the exit. Much to my frustration, the rock table was anything but flat. At times, it sloped down toward the edge, which made it even more difficult to discover the exit.

The half-hour mark was coming up.

I was hoping to have found the exit or at least one of my pile of rocks, so I knew I had made my way around.

Where was it? Was I even close now, or had I veered off in some wrong direction?

After a while, I stopped, tired and frustrated. I had been going at it for a long time now, and the half-hour mark was nearing.

Even though I wasn't finished, for now at least, I had eliminated most of the obvious cliff-drops. That left only a couple of places that looked promising. I climbed down each of them, but in every case, it became too steep to risk going any further for now.

I looked at my phone, clicking the power on, then quickly shutting it off. I had to save every bit of battery I could.
There were ten minutes left for me to look before I needed to call home.

The panic started to build in me again. I knew what that call would mean. It meant that I was going to have to ask for help. But it was far more than that. It meant that I would have to bring my loving spouse into this whole catastrophe, to become a part of the fear, the uncertainty, the panic.

It also meant contacting Search & Rescue...something I had never had to do.

My heart sank, thinking about the cost of it all, knowing the kind of burden and trauma I was handing over.

For now, I swallowed my fear and set back to looking for the exit.

Another five minutes passed. Nothing.

Just then, off in the distance, I saw a small pile of rocks. I took a few more steps.

Yes! It was my first pile of rocks. I had made it all the way around the rock.

But that meant something else too---I had failed to find the exit.

"Oh my God," I whispered under my breath, absolutely drained, exhausted, and beaten down.

I listened to the words as they escaped me yet again.

But this time, the last word hit me...*God.*

*God.*

The word echoed in my mind like a simple tune that just won't go stop playing. I couldn't ignore it, just like I couldn't ignore the very reason I was on this hike to begin with...my faith.

I was here, as a minister in the Christian faith, and I was lost. Yes, I was lost on this rock, but I was also lost in my faith as well, in what I believed.

My sole intention of being on this rock was to spend some time talking to God and asking myself that very question, *What do I believe?*

In some strange way, it bothered me to be asking that question right now and to consider prayer here in this moment. It seemed somehow phony and typical, like a cliché Christian movie about some guy who finds his faith during a storm on top of a mountain. It made me not want to pray at all.

Still, I did actually believe in God. More than that, I had spent my life defending the idea of God. So why shouldn't I ask God for help? After all, I wasn't asking for a quick recovery from the flu. I was asking for life instead of death. I was desperate.

I was reluctant to proceed, but I continued anyway. "God, I don't know what to do. I've tried everything. I could use some help. Of all the times when I've called on you, this is possibly my most desperate moment. Please help me!"

I offered the most sincere prayer a minister or Christian (or human) could manage.

For one brief moment, I humored myself with the thought of some glowing light appearing in the distance that would lead me to the pathway off.

It was an all too common storyline. I had listened to the same basic formula more times than I could count, from countless Sunday pulpits; variations on a theme.

But here, trapped on this rock, battered by the relentless rain and wind, it was real. This was no Sunday Morning Sermon. Would I love to be delivered from danger by some miraculous wonder? Of course! Who wouldn't? But I wasn't sitting on a pew. I was here on this rock.

Even so, I looked around in every direction in a last-ditch effort to discover some sort of God-sent sign.

Nothing...I had to move on.

I had said my prayer. Let God help as God pleases. For now, I needed to help myself.

<div class="section" id="reluctant">

## A Reluctant Call

Every part of me was aching.

To say it was cold would be an understatement.

It was a biting cold, the kind that made your skin feel like it was on fire.

But it was more than a biting frost. The rain was pouring down like an icy-cold shower turned on full. The water was leaking through my clothes and pulling heat directly from my skin. I might as well have been swimming in an icy river.

Though most of my exposed skin had long since gone numb, everything underneath---the muscle, the tendon and bone---were throbbing in agony.

My body had begun to shiver. This wasn't just a chilling-morning, where's-my-coffee shiver. Every muscle in my body was shaking and convulsing in an attempt to create and maintain body heat.

My back, however, was the worst of it. Having stopped to rest, it began to go beyond just shaking. It was now beginning to spasm and seize up.

*What was happening?*

I moved my arms and legs around and tried to stretch. But nothing was helping.

My body was trying to tell me something...I was losing too much body heat.

I knew what this was, and it shocked me. I was entering the early stages of hypothermia.

I couldn't wait any longer to call. I needed to ask for help now. I didn't want to acknowledge it, but the truth is, I didn't know how long I could survive under these conditions.

I reached in my pocket and pulled out my phone, brushing the water off of it. All I could do was pray that all of the marketing around its water-resistance was more than just good advertising.

I dialed and took a deep breath, waiting for the call to connect. Everything in me wanted to resist what would come next. I knew when I called, there would be no way to sugarcoat it. I would have to bring someone I loved, who was enjoying a peaceful afternoon, into the chaos, into the fear, and into the panic.

I held the phone to my ear, dreading the conversation more with every ring.

The line connected.

As if from another world, the voice I had heard a thousand times before, answered, "Hey Love. How are you holding up?".

There amidst all of the terror and all of the tragedy around me, I heard the calm concerned voice of my spouse, the person I loved most in this world. It was so wonderful, so comforting.

I held the phone as close to my mouth as I could and said the four words I was so desperately hoping I would not have to use.

I let out a quivering sigh and spoke: "Babe, I need your help..."
