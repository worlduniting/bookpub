    <p>
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) represent a major breakthrough in how
    Web-page designers work by expanding their ability to control the
    appearance of Web pages, which are the documents that people publish on
    the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the first few years after the World Wide Web (the Web) was created
    in 1990, people who wanted to put pages on the Web had little control
    over what those pages looked like. In the beginning, authors could only
    specify structural aspects of their pages (for example, that some piece
    of text would be a heading or some other piece would be straight text).
    Also, there were ways to make text bold or italic, among a few other
    effects, but that's where their control ended.

    <h2>The Web</h2>
    <p>
        The Web is a vast collection of documents on the
        <dfn id="dfn-internet">Internet</dfn> that are linked together via
        hyperlinks. The Internet consists of millions of computers worldwide
        that communicate electronically. A
        <dfn id="dfn-hyperlink">hyperlink</dfn> is a predefined link between
        two documents. The hyperlinks allow a user to access documents on
        various Web servers without concern for where they are located. A
        <dfn id="dfn-web-server">Web server</dfn> is a computer on the
        Internet that serves out Web pages on request. From a document on a
        Web server in California, the user is just one mouse click away from a
        document that is stored, perhaps, on a Web server in France.
        Hyperlinks are integral to the Web. Without them, there would be no
        Web.

        <h3>Development of the Web</h3>
        <p>
        The Web was invented around 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee with Robert
        Cailliau as a close ally. Both of them were then working at
        <dfn id="dfn-cern">CERN</dfn>, which is the European Laboratory for
        Particle Physics. Tim is a graduate of Oxford University and a
        long-time computer and software expert, and is now the director of
        the <dfn id="dfn-w3c">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</dfn>, an
        organization that coordinates the development of the Web. He also is
        a principal research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology's Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial
        Intelligence (MIT CSAIL). Robert is a 30-year veteran at CERN, where
        he still works. Robert organized the first Web conference in Geneva
        in 1993. Both Tim and Robert were awarded the ACM Software System
        Award in 1995 because of their work on the Web.

    <h3>Adding images</h3>
    <p>
        Images proliferate on the Web. It wasn't until the Mosaic browser
        added support for images in 1993 that a critical mass of people
        realized the potential of the Web. You can add images to your
        documents with the <span class="element">img</span> element �
        <span class="element">img</span> is short for image.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the image is ready, the page looks like
        <a
        class="figref"
        href="https://www.wiumlie.no/2005/ala/sample.html#fig-loaded"
        >this figure</a
