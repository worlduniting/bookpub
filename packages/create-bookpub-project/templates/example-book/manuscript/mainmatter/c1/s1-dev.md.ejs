  <h3>Development of the Web</h3>

  <p>The Web was invented around 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee with
    Robert Cailliau as a close ally. Both of them were then
    working at <dfn id="dfn-cern">CERN</dfn>, which is the European Laboratory for Particle
    Physics. Tim is a graduate of Oxford University and a
    long-time computer and software expert, and is now the director
    of the <dfn id="dfn-w3c">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</dfn>, an organization that
    coordinates the development of the Web. He also is a
    principal research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of
    Technology's Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial
    Intelligence (MIT CSAIL). Robert is a 30-year veteran at
    CERN, where he still works. Robert organized the
    first Web conference in Geneva in 1993. Both Tim and Robert
    were awarded the ACM Software System Award in 1995 because
    of their work on the Web.</p>
