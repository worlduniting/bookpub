<p class="sidenote">The box <a class="pageref" href="#specs">&ldquo;CSS Specifications&rdquo;</a> lists the different CSS specifications.</p>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) represent a major breakthrough in how Web-page designers work by expanding their ability to control the appearance of Web pages, which are the documents that people publish on the Web.</p>

<p>For the first few years after the World Wide Web (the Web) was created in 1990, people who wanted to put pages on the Web had little control over what those pages looked like. In the beginning, authors could only specify structural aspects of their pages (for example, that some piece of text would be a heading or some other piece would be straight text). Also, there were ways to make text bold or italic, among a few other effects, but that's where their control ended.</p>

<h3>Development of the Web</h3>

<p>The Web was invented around 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee with
Robert Cailliau as a close ally. Both of them were then
working at <dfn id="dfn-cern">CERN</dfn>, which is the European Laboratory for Particle
Physics. Tim is a graduate of Oxford University and a
long-time computer and software expert, and is now the director
of the <dfn id="dfn-w3c">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</dfn>, an organization that
coordinates the development of the Web. He also is a
principal research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence (MIT CSAIL). Robert is a 30-year veteran at
CERN, where he still works. Robert organized the
first Web conference in Geneva in 1993. Both Tim and Robert
were awarded the ACM Software System Award in 1995 because
of their work on the Web.</p>

<h3>Adding images</h3>

<p>Images proliferate on the Web. It wasn't until the Mosaic browser
added support for images in 1993 that a critical mass of people
realized the potential of the Web. You can add images to your
documents with the <span class="element">img</span> element &ndash;
<span class="element">img</span> is short for image.
</p>

<p>When the image is ready, the page looks like <a class="figref" href="#fig-loaded">this figure</a>.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig-loaded">

<p class="caption">The image has been loaded.</p>
<p class="art"><img alt="[image]" src="themes/images/html-18.png" style="width: 100%" /></p>
