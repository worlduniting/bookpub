<p class="sidenote">HTML is the most popular document format on the
Web, and it is used in most of the examples in this book.</p>

<p>As we explained in <a class="chapref" href="html-h-1"><q>The Web and HTML,</q></a>HTML elements enable Web-page designers to mark up a document's structure. The HTML specification lists guidelines on how browsers should display these elements. For example, you can be reasonably sure that the contents of a <span class="element">strong</span> element will be displayed as boldfaced. Also, you can pretty much trust that most browsers will display the
content of an <span class="element">h1</span> element using a big font
size &ndash; at least bigger than the <span class="element">p</span>
element and bigger than the <span class="element">h2</span> element.
But beyond trust and hope, you don't have any control over your text's
appearance.</p>

<h2 class="no-toc">CSS specifications</h2>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets is formally described in three W3C
    specifications: CSS1, CSS2, and CSS 2.1. (As discussed in the
    previous chapter, W3C is the organization that coordinates the
    technical development of the Web.) The first specification, CSS1,
    was issued in December 1996 and describes a simple style sheet
    language mostly for screen-based presentations. CSS1 has around 50
    properties (for example, <span class="property">color</span> and
    <span class="property">font-size</span>). CSS2 was finalized in May
    1998 and builds on CSS1. CSS2 includes all CSS1 properties and adds
    around 70 of its own, such as properties to describe aural
    presentations and page breaks.

<p>CSS 2.1 is the most recent specification published by W3C. It
    adds some new features, but CSS 2.1 is mostly a scaled-down version
    of CSS2. CSS2 was an ambitious attempt to describe functionality,
    which Web authors had requested. However, not all the functionality
    is reliably supported by all browsers. CSS 2.1 is a specification
    that describes the parts that <em>are</em> supported by two or
    more browsers. Because CSS 2.1 is similar to CSS2, the
    specification was given a minor version number (that is, 2.1)
    rather than a major number (such as CSS3).</p>
